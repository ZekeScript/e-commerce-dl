## Things I learned

- I started learn React with this project. So, everithing was new, I spend a lot of hours reading the documentation for the develop of every new feature.

- But the biggest obstacule I have was the BaaS in Firebase. It was a new world for me. Right now I don't understand how it this service works with none errors in my program, fortunately.
